Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
- The DriverPass project is an online tool that helps soon to be drivers successfully pass the driver's test. It gives students the opportunity to take online courses and register for in-person driving training. the client was the DriverPass company.

What did you do particularly well?
- I created a very thorough and well written design document detailing all of the objectives of the application as well as several of the requirements and constraints. 
 
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would choose my System Design Document to revise as a whole, but as for a specific section of the document, the diagrams could use some work. To improve it, I would spend a little more time working on the details of the diagrams.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- To best interpret the needs of the user, I spent a large amount of time reading and digesting the interview transcript. I took several notes on the transcript on every read through after the first read through. Considering the user's needs when developing software is important because if the user cannot effectively use the software, then the creation of the software could be in vain and the software could fail.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
- In the past, when designing software, I would just dive right in and start coding. After the completion of this class and other classes at SNHU, I've learned that rigorously planning for the creation of the software before actually creating the software is a much more effective approach in creating a solid product.
